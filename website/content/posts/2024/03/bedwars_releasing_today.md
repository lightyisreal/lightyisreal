Today is the day BedWars will finally be released, after six months from the announcement. For those who don’t know, The Hive, a Minecraft Bedrock Edition featured server, is releasing its take on BedWars to completely replace Treasure Wars.

To keep it short, Treasure Wars was BedWars, but with treasures and a few differences from the original game mode from Hypixel. The problem with Treasure Wars was that it didn’t receive as many updates as people expected when “Treasure Wars: Seasons” was first announced, so people started complaining about the lack of Treasure Wars updates.

If you want to see some Treasure Wars gameplay, I highly recommend you check out Diecies's last Treasure Wars Thursday:

## What do we know so far?

From what the Hive team said, we can expect **seasons** from day 1. This means that we will get frequent updates, compared to Treasure Wars. BedWars will also have **challenges**, allowing for replayability and other ways to play the game. BedWars will get the **microhub** treatment too, meaning that players will be able to explore a different hub with many things to do (fun fact: punching someone in a microhub shows their game stats).

BedWars will also have its core mechanics changed from BedWars:

* Instead of basic gold summoners, we'll get generators that can be upgraded to generate other currencies (most likely diamonds and emeralds).
* Each team will have their upgrades. I'm thinking of things like bed protection, armor protection, and weapon sharpness (basically like Hypixel).
* You can now see the health of enemies with damage indicators that appear at the top (or bottom, I don't know) of the player's name tag.
* A new shop UI was added to replace the unreliable form UI. People are quite split about the change, but I like it. Alongside a new shop UI, new items have been added as well, to "provide different ways to play the game".

Yes, I've got my [sources](https://playhive.com/2023/09/11/treasure-wars/) to prove what I've said so far (check them out, they're official).

## What can we expect?

If everything goes well, we can expect a higher player count because everyone in the Minecraft community knows about BedWars, right? Another reason why we can expect that is because content creation will get a whole lot better, think about it: people are more likely to click on a video containing BedWars in the title, rather than Treasure Wars (they probably think "What is a treasure wars?"). The YouTube algorithm usually picks something more known to people.

What we can also expect is (maybe, just maybe) more Java players trying out Bedrock. Think about it: content creators that will upload their "Trying out Bedrock" video are more likely to get the viewer less confused, therefore the retention is higher. It's more about content creation than anything else, honestly, but it's also good for players because you'll have "quests" that will challenge you to play BedWars in different ways than usual for a reward that's worth the effort.

## In conclusion...

What do you think? Is BedWars good, or will it be the same as Treasure Wars but worse? Let me know in the comments down below. Check out my Discord server too, as it's now ready.

BedWars is expected to release on **March 30th** at **1:00 AM GMT+1**, so I hope you're there.
