It was **8:30 PM** on the clock, it was dark. While Lighty was traveling with his friend, he noticed the aurora lights in the night sky. He stopped the car and got out of it to admire the sky with this light. While he was asking himself why he didn't go outside exploring the world, he felt different. As he kept looking at the night sky, he smiled and started shedding tears. He couldn't explain why he was doing that.

His friend got out of the came to him, making sure he was okay. Lighty told him to look at the sky and tell him what he was thinking. His friend could not understand. Lighty proceeded to tell him how he was thinking about himself during their trip, and that this triggered him somehow. After this moment, he and his friend both got back in the car. Then, Lighty started driving again while he thought of what just happened to him.

Lighty felt like this was going to be a significant part of his life, and that things would change drastically after the trip. He kept close attention to his surroundings and feelings. He made sure to document everything in his diary, so he could keep track of what changed.
