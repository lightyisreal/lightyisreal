I don't have much to say in this blog post, to be honest. It's been a while since I posted something here, so I thought that my birthday would be a good occasion to write something. During these three months, I went through a growing-up phase. I started to understand more about myself and what I want to do in the future. I also dealt with some personal issues, but I'm glad I managed to overcome them. I'm really happy that I made it this far because I became proud and confident of myself, and I'm really excited (as much as my family is) about what the future holds for me.

How does it feel to be 18? Well, right now it seems like nothing changed, but under the hood, I feel like I have more responsibilities and I have to take care of myself more. The reason I hid my age previously was because I wanted to keep myself safe, but also because I felt like people would treat me differently if they knew my age. Now that I'm 18, I feel like I can be more open about myself and my age, and I can be more confident about myself.

I'm really grateful to everyone who supported and still supports me for the person that I am. I want to thank two people in particular: my two closest friends, who actually understand me and support me for who I am. I'm really grateful for them, and I'm really happy that I have them in my life. I hope that we will continue to be friends for a long time. Most importantly, I want to thank my family for supporting my dreams and my goals.

Now, it's time to move on to the real next chapter to my life. I feel like these three months were a precursor to that chapter, and I'm really excited to see what the future holds for me. Thank you all so much for supporting me, and I hope you will continue to support me in the future. ðŸ’–
