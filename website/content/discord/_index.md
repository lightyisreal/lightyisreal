## Rules

As with any other Discord server, this one also has rules. The goal of these rules is to keep the server safe, but to also give people a list of what to expect from their behavior. Read these rules with patience, please.

### Be respectful

There's no need for mean, rude, or harassing comments. Treat others the way you want to be treated (because that's what you've been taught for your entire life). Any bigotry towards any minority will be severely punished. If you need to criticize something or talk about controversial topics, constructive criticism is the way to do it.

> You are allowed to joke about other people as much as you want, but only if it's made in a joking way and if they are okay with it. You're not allowed to talk about notorious bad figures of the past who were involved with the discrimination of people.

### Do not spam or flood the chat

Unless allowed by the server staff, you're not allowed to send small messages in a really short span of time. Doing so hurts other server members as they can't check the chat history, the server staff as they can't properly moderate the server, and you as you're wasting time typing random stuff people are not going to care about.

> Basically, sending a lot of emojis and repeating messages at the same time is not allowed.

### The server is PG-13

Quoting from a page from the [Michigan State University](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/what_do_movie_ratings_mean) website, "This rating is a stronger caution for parents that content included may not be appropriate for children under 13 (pre-teen ages). This may include stronger language, extended violence or sexual situations and drug-use. Remember, the content will vary with each movie, so check the specific movie rating for the film you are researching."

This means that any explicit talk or content that exceedes what the limit of a PG-13 movie is not allowed. Also, the server staff reserves any right to remove any content that is not deemed appropriate for the server.

> You’re allowed to talk about things that are not directly linked to NSFW things, but you’re not allowed to share any kind of NSFW material or talk about explicit topics. For example, using the word `sex` is allowed as long as you don’t go further with the topic.

### Don't talk about politics or religious topics

Politics and religion are two topics that can divide people. It's best to avoid talking about them, as they can lead to arguments and fights. If you want to talk about these topics, you can do so in a private chat with someone who is interested in the topic.

### Use an appropriate Discord profile

Your Discord username and profile (display name, avatar, status, bio, pronouns, etc.) must be appropriate, and should not contain political imagery or figures. Any violation of this rule will result in a quick ban without questioning.

> For example, having a slur or a political figure is a bannable offense. Keep your username and profile unique.

### Stay safe, seriously

Be careful of what you share. Generally speaking, you shouldn't share personal information about yourself. This includes posting information about your age or accurate location.

> If you share your personal information, it will be easy for people to create biases against you, making it harder to find new people to talk with. It's not allowed under any circumstances to share personal information about someone else, as we don't know for certain if you have permission from them to do so.

### Follow the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)

You must be at least 13 years old (or the legal digital consent age in your country) to use Discord, and abide by all other terms and guidelines. Any discussion about illegal topics or any claims that you are under the age of 13 will be taken seriously and result in a permanent ban.

> Why this? Sadly, Discord's report system has a flaw that allows anyone to falsely report someone, even if they joke about their age. Not only that, we also can't know a certain someone's age.

### More, but not important, rules

- **King :3** (a. k. a. `xkingdark`) is and always will be the only king around here
- **ExplosionHm** is the true sigma amongst the rizzlers
- **ExplosionHm** and **WizLeMonke** are the best moderators in the server

## How do I appeal?

Well, you can't.
