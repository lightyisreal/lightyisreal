**How did you become so good at coding?**

I started when I was younger. I wanted to code a UI for my SkyBlock server and I did just that. After that, I learned how to code Discord bots in JavaScript because MEE6 locked many things behind a paywall. About 2 years later, I wanted to make this my job, so I started getting serious with it.

**Can you work for free?**

While I don't care about money and have people's interest in mind, I need some sort of income until I get a stable job. If you're unsure about my coding skills, check out my [portfolio](/portfolio/), you won't be disappointed.

**Can we collab?**

Hit me up on [Discord](https://lighty.tech/discord) and we can talk about it. Keep in mind that I'm not always available.

**What games do you play?**

I play lots of games. Minecraft is the main game I play. I also play osu! - the rhythm game I like the most - and Geometry Dash - that one game that makes you rage every time you die. I've got a big Steam library of games, but I dont't actually play them all.

**Who made your Minecraft skin?**

My Minecraft skin was made by [Gappled](https://www.youtube.com/@Gappled). Please, go subscribe to him on YouTube. He has to reach that 1000 subscribers goal. As for the custom cape I use on Minecraft Bedrock Edition, it was made by my friend [CaptainTom](https://www.youtube.com/@CaptainTom4862); he's awesome. If you want to download it, here is the [persona skin pack](/files/lightbulb_experience.7z). Follow the [BionicBen cape method video](https://youtu.be/0TyUCqAMWLg?si=__4ThvYx-jCEAvu8) to install the skin pack.
