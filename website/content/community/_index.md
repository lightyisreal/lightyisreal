## Rules

If you opened this page, this means that you have access to my private friend group thing. As with any other community, this one also has rules, but not as many as you would think. The goal of these rules is to keep the server safe. Read these rules with patience, please.

### Be respectful

There's no need for mean, rude, or harassing comments. Treat others the way you want to be treated (because that's what you've been taught for your entire life). Any bigotry towards any minority will be severely punished. If you need to criticize something or talk about controversial topics, constructive criticism is the way to do it.

> You are allowed to joke about other people as much as you want, but only if it's made in a joking way and if they are okay with it.

### The server is PG-13

Any explicit talk or content that exceedes what the limit of a PG-13 movie is not allowed. Also, the server staff reserves any right to remove any content that is not deemed appropriate for the server.

> You’re allowed to talk about things that are not directly linked to NSFW things, but you’re not allowed to share any kind of NSFW material or talk about explicit topics. For example, using the word `sex` is allowed as long as you don’t go further with the topic.

### Don't talk about politics or religious topics

Politics and religion are two topics that can divide people. It's best to avoid talking about them, as they can lead to arguments and fights. If you want to talk about these topics, you can do so in a private chat with someone who is interested in the topic.

### Use an appropriate Discord profile

Your Discord username and profile (display name, avatar, status, bio, pronouns, etc.) must be appropriate, and should not contain political imagery or figures. Any violation of this rule will result in a quick ban without questioning.

> For example, having a slur or a political figure is a bannable offense. Keep your username and profile unique.

### Stay safe, seriously

Be careful of what you share. Generally speaking, you shouldn't share personal information about yourself. This includes posting information about your age or accurate location.

> If you share your personal information, it will be easy for people to create biases against you, making it harder to find new people to talk with. It's not allowed under any circumstances to share personal information about someone else, as we don't know for certain if you have permission from them to do so.
