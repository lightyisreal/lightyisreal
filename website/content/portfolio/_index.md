Welcome to my portfolio. So far, these are the projects I coded (or was involved with) that I consider ready for a showcase.

**Coding**

* **[This website](/)** (March 2024 - now): The website itself showcases my ability to use Hugo to make static websites and my ability to work with themes too. The reason a website was made was to give a professional look to my online identity and to also be able to say whatever I want without getting my posts removed because of censorship.
* **[Evident Battle Royale](https://youtu.be/Zkk03AqvIsI?si=8_EwWjW6Ey8g2D1v)** (Summer 2023): This Minecraft Bedrock Edition add-on was made upon a commission from Evident. It was used for his 100 players Battle Royale event. *Click the link to see how it went.*
* **[Evident Server Engine](evident)** (Summer 2023 - now): The server was made upon a commission from Evident. It was made using Dragonfly, a server software library made in Go. *Click the link for more information.*
* **[Hera](https://github.com/MineCube-MC/hera.git)** (July 13th 2021 - July 15th 2023): This is a Discord bot I worked on during my free time since July 2021. I stopped working on it in 2023 because I wanted to primarily focus on Minecraft related projects. The project is now under an organization I gave ownership to someone else and archived on GitHub.
* **[Knock](https://github.com/MineCube-MC/knock.git)** (December 20th 2020 - now): The oldest big project I worked on. This is a remake of an iconic minigame where you knock people in the void. There was a plugin already, but it didn't work with PocketMine 3 (that was the latest version at the time), so I decided to re-code it for that version of the server. The project is now under an organization I gave ownership to someone else and maintained to this day (not frequently, though).

**Video Editing**

Even if I'm not focused on video editing, I still edit some videos for myself or for people who ask me.

* **[My YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@lightyisreal)** (April 1st 2024 - now): in this channel I upload videos to express my creativity to the public.
